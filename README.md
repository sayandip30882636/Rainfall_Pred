This project focuses on predicting next-day rainfall in Australia using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**. Inspired by the structure of the human brain, ANNs are powerful computational models capable of identifying complex patterns in data. The primary goal of this project is to develop a high-accuracy machine learning model that can predict rainfall based on historical weather data. The dataset, sourced from **Kaggle**, contains various meteorological parameters such as humidity, wind speed, temperature, and cloud cover. To ensure optimal model performance, data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, feature scaling, and dataset balancing were applied before splitting the data into training and testing sets. The ANN model is structured with an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer, utilizing activation functions and batch normalization for efficient learning. The training process involves forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent optimization to minimize errors.  

Model evaluation is conducted using key performance metrics, achieving an **accuracy of 89%**, an **R-squared score of 0.63**, and an **ROC-AUC value of 0.82**, indicating high sensitivity and a low false-positive rate. The model's effectiveness is further validated through a **confusion matrix, F1-score, precision, and recall**, with values around **85%**. Additionally, its performance is compared with other machine learning models such as **Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree**, highlighting its superiority. The project demonstrates that increasing the number of hidden layers and epochs can further enhance model accuracy. The findings emphasize the importance of **data preprocessing, feature selection, and neural network optimization** in improving prediction performance. This research contributes to **weather forecasting and climate analytics**, showcasing how **machine learning, particularly ANNs, can enhance meteorological predictions** and assist in better decision-making regarding weather-related events.
